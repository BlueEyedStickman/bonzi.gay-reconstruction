# bonzi.gay reconstruction
This is a high quality replica of bonzi.gay, made by Jim Megatron and UnrealSticky, aiming to be as close as possible to the original bonzi.gay
The aim is also to be lightweight and not be clusterfucked like 90% of servers, making this better than most of the other servers!

Default godword is 'bonzi' and default kingword is 'king'. Please change them beforehand

## SETUP
This is important.
1. npm install
```bash
npm install
```
2. change the godword and kingword. if you're lazy you might get banned or skiddied on.

3. run it!
```bash
node server.js
```
By default, the server runs on port 80.
